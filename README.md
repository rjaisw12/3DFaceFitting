## Overview
This project aims to reconstruct a 3D face mesh given a single color image.
It is inspired by multiple papers including:
- https://niessnerlab.org/papers/2015/11face/thies2015realtime.pdf
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.00523.pdf
It is based on top of the library Pytorch3D to take advantage of its differentiable renders
